 I need to write a Python script but I'm not sure where to start. Can you guide me through the basic steps? I have some programming experience but I'm new to Python. Also, what are some common pitfalls I should avoid?

Okay, the user wants to write a Python script but is new to Python. They have some programming experience, so they might understand basic concepts like variables, loops, etc., but need guidance on Python-specific steps. Let me outline the basic steps to create a Python script.

First, they need to install Python if they haven't already. Then, setting up a development environmentâ€”maybe recommend an IDE or a text editor. Next, the structure of a Python script: starting with shebang line, imports, functions, main block. Common pitfalls: indentation errors, not using virtual environments, mutable default arguments, etc. Also, maybe mention using if __name__ == "__main__" to make the script executable. Should I include a simple example? Yes, that would help. Also, remind them to save the file with .py extension and run it via command line. Testing and debugging tips? Maybe mention print statements or using a debugger. List the steps in order, and then the pitfalls separately. Make sure to keep it clear and concise for someone transitioning from another language.

Here's a step-by-step guide to writing a Python script and common pitfalls to avoid:

**Steps to Write a Python Script:**
1. **Install Python**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Verify with `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal.
2. **Choose an Editor**: Use VS Code, PyCharm, or a simple text editor like Sublime Text.
3. **Create a File**: Save with a `.py` extension (e.g., `myscript.py`).
4. **Script Structure**:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3  (Optional shebang for Unix-like systems)
   
   import modules  # Import required libraries
   
   def main():
       # Your code logic here
       print("Hello, World!")
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()  # Ensures code runs when executed directly
   ```
5. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python3 myscript.py  # Or `python myscript.py` depending on your system
   ```

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- **Indentation Errors**: Python uses whitespace (4 spaces recommended) for code blocks.
- **Mutable Default Arguments**: 
  ```python
  def bad_example(arg=[]):  # Avoid!
  def good_example(arg=None):  # Use None instead
      arg = arg or []
  ```
- **Not Using Virtual Environments**: Isolate dependencies with `venv`:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv myenv
  source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
  myenv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
  ```
- **Ignoring Exceptions**: Use try/except blocks meaningfully instead of empty catches.
- **Global Variables**: Prefer passing arguments to functions over globals.

**Testing Tips**:
- Use `print()` for quick debugging.
- Write unit tests with Python's `unittest` or `pytest`.
- Lint your code with `flake8` or `pylint`.

**Example Script**:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 20
    result = calculate_sum(num1, num2)
    print(f"The sum is: {result}")
```
